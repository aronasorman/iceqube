        For python interpreters older than 3.4, we know that it sets
        all objects leading with an underscore, to None. threading.Event.wait
        depends on _time(), which has an underscore, leading us to raise an
        exception when wait() is called during shutdown. See

        The test here is to see if InfiniteLoopThread (and by extension BaseCloseableThread)
        can handle threading._time being None. We import InfiniteLoopThread
        because it's easier to test.
